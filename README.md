Tic-Tac-Toe Game Project
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was completed as part of The Odin Project tutorial.

Features
Gameplay: Play Tic-Tac-Toe against another player.
Interactive Interface: User-friendly interface with click functionality for game cells.
Win Detection: Logic to detect winning moves and declare the winner.
Responsive Design: Designed with CSS for responsiveness on various screen sizes.
Project Structure
The project is organized using the Module Pattern in JavaScript to encapsulate functionality within separate modules:

HTML: Contains the structure of the game board and interface elements.
CSS: Stylesheet for the visual presentation, including responsive design aspects.
JavaScript Modules:
Game Logic: Manages the game state, checks for wins, handles turns, and determines outcomes.
Display Controller: Controls the display of the game board and updates based on game state changes.
Main Module: Orchestrates the interaction between the game logic and the display.
How to Play
Open the HTML file in a web browser.
Two players take turns by clicking on the empty cells to place their marks (X or O).
The game detects winning combinations and declares the winner or a tie.
Development Notes
This project was a great opportunity to practice modular JavaScript design patterns. The use of modules allowed for better organization, separation of concerns, and easy maintenance of the codebase.
